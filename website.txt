It's been my mission for a long time to create my own portfolio website. After completing a fully fledged portfolio project that I felt proud of despite it being a pretty basic data visualization analysis, I felt I was ready to publish it, get some feedback and open myself up to being able to apply to jobs and start working on other projects. I considered using websites like WordPress or Squarespace to help me create it. That's how I used to make websites as a kid when I had some wild and crazy business ideas, so I thought how hard could it be. It should be an easy process where I can get my website up and running fairly quickly. I was wrong. Soon after I started exploring those options, I was overwhelmed with the interface, the cost, and it just ended up having a bigger learning curve than I realized. I eventually thought, why not code it myself? What's stopping me, I have the experience, the drive to learn something new, why not make something that I can truly be proud of creating. So I took the step forward, researching how to make my own website from scratch, I've done it before locally, but never created a true, beautiful website through html. I started with the basics, creating the files that I needed to get it running locally, learned how to incorporate pages and tested very very frequently. Customizing it to be exactly how I'd like it and designing it in the best way that represents my style has been liberating and so much fun. I've come across many hurtles and I've learned more about html than the basics I had knowledge on. 


It's been my mission for a long time to create my own portfolio website. After finishing a full data visualization project I was actually proud of, despite it being basic in scope, I felt ready to put it out into the world. I wanted feedback, visibility, and a place to showcase my future work. It was time to stop waiting for everything to be better quality and time to just start publishing.

I looked into using site builders like WordPress and Squarespace. I figured it'd be quick and easy, I'd have my site up and running in no time. Besides, that's how I used to create websites as a kid whenever I had some wild and crazy business idea. Turns out, it wasn't as simple as I was hoping for. The interfaces were overwhelming, the customization was complicated, the price tags added up, and honestly, the learning curve was steeper than I expected. I was spending more time fighting their systems than building my own thing.

So I started wondering, why not just code it myself? I already have coding experience, an interest to learn something new, and a clear vision of what I wanted. I decided to go for it and build a website from scratch. I'd done local web projects before, but this time I wanted something real, something live, polished, and truly mine.

I started with the basics, building the HTML structure, setting up pages, testing constantly, and refining the design to match my personal style. Customizing everything exactly like I wanted was liberating. It's been a mix of fun, frustration, and steady progress. I've run into plenty of hurdles, but I've also gained more knowledge on HTML than  started with.

One of the biggest steps that was a little out of my comfort zone was learning how to actually get it online. For the first time, I used GitHub Pages to host it temporarily. I created repositories specifically for the site, which was totally different from how I've used GitHub before, for school projects or version control. Hosting it through GitHub gave me a deeper understanding of how web projects are structured and deployed, and it felt like a big milestone when it finally came online.
