            <h1>Analyzing Best Selling Books</h1>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project explores the information on the 100 top-selling books, ranked by their worldwide sales, using a range of visualizations. We will discover trends and gain insights into authors, genres, publishing trends, and reader behaviors.</p>

            <h3>Source</h3>
            <p>The dataset that we will use was obtained from Kaggle, Bestsellers Unveiled: Global Top Selling Books by Maria Nadeem. This dataset contains information about the world's best-selling books, with a focus on sales volume and other related details.</p>

            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>We will be working with this list of world best-selling books to answer the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are the most popular genres?</li>
                <li>Do some genres tend to generate more total sales than others?</li>
                <li>Which publishers have the most books on the list?</li>
                <li>Which authors have the highest total sales?</li>
                <li>Which authors sell the most per book, and how does that differ from the placement of total sales?</li>
                <li>How does the number of books an author has on the list relate to their total sales?</li>
                <li>Which authors exceed or fall short of expectations based on how many best-selling books they have?</li>
            </ul>
