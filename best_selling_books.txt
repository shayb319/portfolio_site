Analyzing Best-Selling Books

Introduction
We've all come across those books before, you know the ones with the stickers on the covers trying to convince you to buy it since it's written by a best-selling author. Well, have you ever wondered what makes someone a best-selling author? In this project, we'll be taking a look into the world of best-selling books, using data to uncover trends and insights that would normally be hard to see. We'll explore popular genres, publisher presence in the market and discovering if the best-selling title is really something special.

The Dataset
Our dataset, Bestsellers Unveiled: Global Top Selling Books, was sourced from Kaggle and compiled by Maria Nadeem. It gives us details on the top 100 best-selling books, offering information about books titles, authors, publishers, genres, sales volume and overall rankings.

Key Questions We're Asking
Here are some questions we'll be looking to answer with this data:

What are the most popular genres?
Do some genres tend to generate more total sales than others?
Which publishers have the most books on the list?
Which authors have the highest total sales?
Which authors sell the most per book, and how does that differ from the placement of total sales?
How does the number of books an author has on the list relate to their total sales?
Which authors exceed or fall short of expectations based on how many best-selling books they have?
