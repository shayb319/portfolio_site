            <h1>Building My Portfolio Site From Scratch</h1>
            <p>
                It's been my mission for a long time to create my own portfolio website. After finishing 
                a full data visualization project I was actually proud of, despite it being basic in scope, 
                I felt ready to put it out into the world. I wanted feedback, visibility, and a place to 
                showcase my future work. It was time to stop waiting for everything to be better quality 
                and time to just start publishing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I looked into using site builders like WordPress and Squarespace. I figured it'd be quick 
                and easy, I'd have my site up and running in no time. Besides, that's how I used to create 
                websites as a kid whenever I had some wild and crazy business idea. Turns out, it wasn't 
                as simple as I was hoping for. The interfaces were overwhelming, the customization was 
                complicated, the price tags added up, and honestly, the learning curve was steeper than I 
                expected. I was spending more time fighting their systems than building my own thing.
            </p>
            <p>So I started wondering, why not just code it myself? I already have coding experience, an 
                interest to learn something new, and a clear vision of what I wanted. I decided to go for 
                it and build a website from scratch. I'd done local web projects before, but this time I 
                wanted something real, something live, polished, and truly mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with the basics, building the HTML structure, setting up pages, testing constantly, 
                and refining the design to match my personal style. Customizing everything exactly like I 
                wanted was liberating. It's been a mix of fun, frustration, and steady progress. I've run into 
                plenty of hurdles, but I've also gained more knowledge on HTML than  started with.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the biggest steps that was a little out of my comfort zone was learning how to actually 
                get it online. For the first time, I used GitHub Pages to host it temporarily. I created 
                repositories specifically for the site, which was totally different from how I've used GitHub 
                before, for school projects or version control. Hosting it through GitHub gave me a deeper 
                understanding of how web projects are structured and deployed, and it felt like a big milestone 
                when it finally came online.
