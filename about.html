            <p>
                I went to college knowing one thing: I loved math. I know, that's 
                a really weird thing to say, not many people do. At least I was 
                going into college with a major in mind. I didn’t know what career 
                it would lead me to, but I knew I was good at thinking critically 
                and solving problems. Math challenged me and I always had fun doing 
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I took a required Computer Science I course and everything 
                changed. It was hard. It was confusing. And I couldn’t get enough 
                of it. There’s a moment when you finally get your code to compile, 
                and it works, and you realize you made that logic happen. Those 
                were the moments that felt rewarding and made me realize how much 
                I enjoyed it.
            </p>
            <p>
                From there, I kept digging. I stuck with my math major and added 
                a computer science minor. I started asking myself: What can I do 
                with both of these skills? That led me to data science — a field 
                that I found was a great mix between logic, exploration, and 
                real-world impact. You get to analyze, optimize, build tools, and 
                actually answer questions that matter. I became hooked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the way, I became a peer tutor in math, helping students who 
                didn’t want to be in those classes find a reason to care. I had to 
                learn how to teach differently, communicate clearly, and meet 
                people where they were. That experience shaped me just as much as 
                any course. It gave me patience, empathy, and an edge in explaining 
                complex ideas in simple terms.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since then, I've built pipelines, visualized insights, cleaned 
                messy datasets, and optimized AI models. I’ve worked in government 
                contracts, chatbot evaluations, and contact center ops. I’ve used 
                Python, SQL, Jupyter, Tableau, HTML, JavaScript, C++, StreamSets, 
                and more. The most rewarding of all is I’ve felt like I've built 
                real things that made real impacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not diving deep into data, I’m either exploring my 
                creativity, getting lost in imaginary worlds or finding a way to 
                stay grounded. My creativity comes out through my drawings and 
                paintings as well as my passion for music by playing the piano. 
                I love reading a good novel and finding balance through yoga. I 
                like to organize chaos whether that’s writing scripts to streamline 
                my life or building dashboards to track habits, budgets, or random 
                curiosities. My brain likes structure, and I build systems to make 
                life easier and more enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m someone who likes to figure things out whether it’s the root 
                of a messy dataset or the best way to explain a hard concept. I 
                aim to keep learning, keep building, and keep making sense of 
                complexity.
